## Table of contents

## The basics
This game plays ***just*** like *Connect4* both players take turns dropping a piece unto the board, the first to get four in a line (either vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) wins! 
The only difference is that in *Connect4 3D* you just play in one more dimension.  
That is probably confusing *How exactly do you extend a 2D game into 3D?* Simple just put more games behind the original one forming a cube. of *Connect4*.  
In order to be able to access all of the game (even if its behind something else) you have to select which layer you're looking at.

## The Controls
When you start the game you'll see 3 boards, these are just different visualizations of the same 3D game.  <br/><br/>
